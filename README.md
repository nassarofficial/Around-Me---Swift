# AroundMe Swift Google Places

This project pulls nearby locations from Google Places API, to overlay the camera view with ARKIT (Augmented Reality) the places right on the camera view with distance.

This project is based on Around Me - Swift which was based on "Augmented Reality iOS Tutorial: Location Based" tutorial at raywenderlich.com

Note : This project has some the differences compared with the objective project in raywenderlich.com. I made some changes for my own purpose.
